# Exercise catalogue sources

Reviewed 2026-09-30 for the 0.3.0 seed expansion. The catalogue contains 43 entries: the original eight, 19 additional kettlebell movements (20 total), five additional push-up variations, five additional plank variations, five additional bodyweight squat variations, and rowing on a rowing machine. The two kettlebell squats are additional to the five bodyweight squat variations.

Descriptions in `apps/nextround/src/data/exercises.ts` are original, concise form cues informed by the sources below, not copied instructions or complete tutorials. The original eight entries, including their IDs, names, descriptions and order, remain unchanged. In particular the first three still supply the default EMOM exercises. New IDs are permanent catalogue identifiers used in saved workouts; rename display text rather than IDs.

Unilateral entries explicitly ask the user to choose a side for the interval; alternating movements say so. These cues do not prescribe weights, repetitions or medical adaptations. Each entry also declares `supportedUnits`: dynamic movements offer reps and seconds; static planks offer seconds; the suitcase carry offers seconds and metres; the rowing machine offers seconds, metres and machine calories. These are target-prescription choices, not measurements or estimates of energy expenditure. Difficulty, equipment and muscle-group taxonomy remain separate work.

## Kettlebells

Greg Brookes publishes these first-party coaching guides and the [exercise library](https://kettlebellsworkouts.com/kettlebell-exercises/). The guides were used for movement definitions and form cues, not their training or health claims.

## Push-ups

NASM's first-party exercise library supplies the five additional variations. NextRound calls the knee-supported modified push-up “Knee push-up” for a clearer picker label.

| `squat-jump` | NASM: [Squat jump](https://www.nasm.org/resource-center/exercise-library/squat-jump) |

## Rowing machine

`rowing-machine` follows Concept2's [indoor rowing technique](https://www.concept2.co.uk/training/rowing-technique) and [technique corrections](https://www.concept2.com/training/improve-your-rowing-technique): leg drive followed by body swing and arm pull; recovery reverses that sequence. This is indoor machine rowing, distinct from a kettlebell row.

## Verification

`apps/nextround/src/data/exercises.test.ts` guards minimum category counts, the original entries' identities/order, the existing Plank search description, unique IDs/names, nonempty concise text, the rower identity, movement-appropriate target units and full catalogue retrieval. Names are limited to 60 characters and descriptions to 240 characters for compact picker/detail text.
